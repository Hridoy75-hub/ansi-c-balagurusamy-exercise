## Chapter 2 

1. Write a program to display the equation of a line in
the form
ax + by = c
for a = 5, b = 8 and c = 18.

2. Write a C program that uses an in-built function to
draw a 3D bar.

3. Write a program to output the following multiplication table

4. Given the values of three variables a, b and c, write
a program to compute and display the value of x,
where x = a / ( b - c ) 
Execute your program for the following values:
(a) a = 250, b = 85, c = 25
(b) a = 300, b = 70, c = 70
Comment on the output in each case.



## Chapter 3 

1. Write a program to determine and print the sum of the following harmonic series for a given value of n:
                        1+ 1/2 +1/3 +....+ 1/n
The value of n should be given interactively through the terminal.

2. The price of one kg of rice is Rs. 16.75 and one kg of sugar is Rs. 15. Write a program to get these values
from the user and display the prices as follows:
      *** LIST OF ITEMS***
      Item          Price
      Rich          Rs 16.75
      Sugar         Rs 15.00

3. Write program to count and print the number of negative and positive numbers in a given set of numbers.
Test your program with a suitable set of numbers. Use scanf to read the numbers. Readingshould be 
terminated when the value 0 is
encountered.

4. Write a program to do the following:
(a) Declare x and y as integer variables and z as a short integer variable.
(b) Assign two 6 digit numbers to x and y
(c) Assign the sum of x and y to z
(d) Output the values of x, y and z
Comment on the output.

5. Write a program to illustrate the use of typedef declaration in a program.

6. Write a program to illustrate the use of symbolicconstants in a real-life application.

7. Write a C program to input an integer and print its table.

8. Write a C program to print the square of a number.

9. Write a C program to input an integer between 0 and 128 and print its ASCII character.

10. Write a C program to input the value of days and convert it into years, weeks and days.

11. Write a C program to input the distance travelled by a car and the fuel consumed. Next,
compute the mileage of the car.

12. Write a C program to input the amount value and break it into the smallest possible 
Indian currency notes.

## Chapter 7 

1)  Given a number, write a program using while loop
to reverse the digits of the number. For example,
the number
12345
should be written as
54321
( Hint: Use modulus operator to extract the last
digit and the integer division by 10 to get the n–1
digit number from the n digit number.)
