## Chapter 2 

1. Write a program to display the equation of a line in the form ax + by = c
for a = 5, b = 8 and c = 18.

2. Write a C program that uses an in-built function to draw a 3D bar.

3. Write a program to output the following multiplication table

4. Given the values of three variables a, b and c, write a program to compute and display the value of x,
where x = a / ( b - c ) 
Execute your program for the following values:
(a) a = 250, b = 85, c = 25
(b) a = 300, b = 70, c = 70
Comment on the output in each case.

5. Write a C program that reads the value of distance travelled by a car and the time taken for the same.
Next, compute the speed at which the car travelled.

6. Write a C program to print the current system date.

7. Given two integers 20 and 10, write a program that uses a function add( ) to add these two numbers
and sub( ) to find the difference of these two numbers and then display the sum and difference in
the following form:
20 + 10 = 30
20 – 10 = 10

8. Modify the above program to provide border lines to the address.

9. Write a program using one print statement to print the pattern of asterisks as shown below:

*
        *  *
        *  *  *
        *  *  *  *
        
10. Write a program that will print the following figure using suitable characters.

11. Area of a triangle is given by the formula
         A = sqrt(s*(s-a)*(S-b)*(s-c))
Where a, b and c are sides of the triangle and 2S = a + b + c. Write a program to compute the area of
the triangle given the values of a, b and c.

12. Write a program to display the following simple arithmetic calculator
       x=                  y=
       sum                 Difference=
       Product=            Division=

13. Distance between two points (x 1, y 1) and (x 2, y 2) is governed by the formula
D2 = (x 2 – x 1)2 + (y 2 – y 1)2
Write a program to compute D given the coordinates of the points.

14. A point on the circumference of a circle whose center is (o, o) is (4,5). Write a program to compute
perimeter and area of the circle. (Hint: use the formula given in the Ex. 2.11)

15. The line joining the points (2,2) and (5,6) which lie on the circumference of a circle is the diameter of
the circle. Write a program to compute the area of the circle.

## Chapter 7 

1)  Given a number, write a program using while loop
to reverse the digits of the number. For example,
the number
12345
should be written as
54321
( Hint: Use modulus operator to extract the last
digit and the integer division by 10 to get the n–1
digit number from the n digit number.)

a given integer number.
