1. Write a program to display the equation of a line in
the form
ax + by = c
for a = 5, b = 8 and c = 18.

2. Write a C program that uses an in-built function to
draw a 3D bar.

3. Write a program to output the following multiplication table

4. Given the values of three variables a, b and c, write
a program to compute and display the value of x,
where x = a / ( b - c ) 
Execute your program for the following values:
(a) a = 250, b = 85, c = 25
(b) a = 300, b = 70, c = 70
Comment on the output in each case.
