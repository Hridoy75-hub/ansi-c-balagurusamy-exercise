1)  Given a number, write a program using while loop
to reverse the digits of the number. For example,
the number
12345
should be written as
54321
( Hint: Use modulus operator to extract the last
digit and the integer division by 10 to get the nâ€“1
digit number from the n digit number.)

2) Write a program to compute the sum of the digits of
a given integer number.
